## Prompt

```bash
sgpt --model=gpt-4 --chat ansible "write an ansible playbook for ubuntu 22 that installs docker, docker-compose, nginx, and fail2ban. give instructions for running the playbook on the linux machine" | tee -a "$filepath"
```

## Response

Sure, here is an Ansible playbook that will install Docker, Docker-compose, Nginx, and Fail2ban on an Ubuntu 22 machine. 

```yaml
---
- hosts: ubuntu
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt: update_cache=yes

    - name: Install required packages
      apt:
        name: ['apt-transport-https', 'ca-certificates', 'curl', 'software-properties-common']
        state: present

    - name: Add Docker GPG apt Key
      apt_key:
        url: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg
        state: present

    - name: Add Docker Repository
      apt_repository:
        repo: deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable
        state: present

    - name: Update apt and install docker-ce
      apt: update_cache=yes name=docker-ce state=latest

    - name: Install Docker Compose
      get_url:
        url: https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m`
        dest: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Install Fail2ban
      apt:
        name: fail2ban
        state: present
...
```

To run this playbook, follow these steps:

1. Save the playbook in a file, for example `setup.yml`.

2. Run the playbook with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini setup.yml
```

In the above command, replace `inventory.ini` with your actual inventory file. The inventory file should contain the IP addresses or hostnames of your Ubuntu 22 machines. Here is an example of what the inventory file might look like:

```ini
[ubuntu]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11
```

In this example, the playbook will be run on the machines with IP addresses 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.11.
## Prompt

```bash
sgpt --model=gpt-4 --chat ansible "add apt update and upgrade to the ansible playbook. include a user in the ansible-playbook command. switch to root user once ssh'ed into the server" | tee -a "$filepath"
```

## Response

Sure, here's the updated playbook with the apt update and upgrade tasks added. Also, the playbook will switch to the root user once it's SSH'ed into the server.

```yaml
---
- hosts: ubuntu
  become: yes
  remote_user: your_username
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt: update_cache=yes

    - name: Upgrade all packages to the latest version
      apt:
        upgrade: dist

    - name: Install required packages
      apt:
        name: ['apt-transport-https', 'ca-certificates', 'curl', 'software-properties-common']
        state: present

    - name: Add Docker GPG apt Key
      apt_key:
        url: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg
        state: present

    - name: Add Docker Repository
      apt_repository:
        repo: deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable
        state: present

    - name: Update apt and install docker-ce
      apt: update_cache=yes name=docker-ce state=latest

    - name: Install Docker Compose
      get_url:
        url: https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m`
        dest: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Install Fail2ban
      apt:
        name: fail2ban
        state: present
...
```

Replace `your_username` with the username you want to use to SSH into the server.

To run this playbook, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini setup.yml -u your_username --ask-become-pass
```

Replace `your_username` with your actual username. The `--ask-become-pass` option will prompt you for the password to switch to the root user.
