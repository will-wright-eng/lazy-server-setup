Project Plan for Setting Up a Hugo Static Site on a Digital Ocean Droplet

1. **Project Setup**
   - Define the project requirements and goals.
   - Set up a project management tool to track progress and assign tasks.

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Install necessary tools on your local machine: Ansible, Terraform, Docker, and Docker Compose.

3. **Infrastructure Setup with Terraform**
   - Write a Terraform script to provision a Digital Ocean droplet.
   - The script should create a droplet with a specific size, region, image (preferably a Docker-ready image), and SSH keys.
   - Apply the Terraform script to create the droplet.

4. **Configuration Management with Ansible**
   - Write an Ansible playbook to configure the droplet.
   - The playbook should install Docker and Docker Compose on the droplet.
   - Test the playbook locally and then run it against the droplet.

5. **Hugo Static Site Setup**
   - Create a Hugo static site on your local machine.
   - Write a Dockerfile for the Hugo site.
   - Build the Docker image and push it to a Docker registry.

6. **Docker Compose Setup**
   - Write a docker-compose.yml file to run the Hugo site.
   - The file should define services for the Hugo site and Fluentd.
   - Apply the Docker Compose file on the droplet to start the services.

7. **Fluentd Setup**
   - Configure Fluentd to collect logs from the Hugo site.
   - Fluentd should be set up as a Docker service in the docker-compose.yml file.

8. **Fail2Ban Setup**
   - Fail2Ban is not typically run inside a Docker container because it needs to interact with the host system to modify firewall rules. Instead, install and configure Fail2Ban directly on the droplet using Ansible.
   - Write an Ansible role to install and configure Fail2Ban on the droplet.
   - Fail2Ban should monitor the SSH and possibly the web server logs for intrusion attempts.

9. **Testing**
   - Thoroughly test the entire setup to ensure everything works as expected.
   - Test the Hugo site, Fluentd log collection, and Fail2Ban intrusion detection.

10. **Deployment**
    - Once everything is tested and working, deploy the setup to the live environment.

11. **Maintenance and Monitoring**
    - Regularly monitor the system for any issues.
    - Update the system and applications as necessary.

This plan assumes that you are familiar with all the mentioned technologies. If you are not, you may need to spend some time learning about them before you can effectively use them in this project.

## Response

**Fluentd Setup**

Fluentd is an open-source data collector, which unifies data collection and consumption for better use and understanding of data. Here's how to set it up:

- Define Fluentd as a service in your Docker Compose file. This will ensure that Fluentd starts whenever your droplet starts.
- Configure Fluentd to collect logs from your Hugo site. This will involve setting up sources in your Fluentd configuration file. The sources will define where Fluentd should read logs from.
- You may also want to set up matches in your Fluentd configuration file. Matches define where Fluentd should send the logs it collects. This could be a log aggregation service or a file on your droplet.

**Fail2Ban Setup**

Fail2Ban is an intrusion prevention software framework that protects computer servers from brute-force attacks. Here's how to set it up:

- Write an Ansible role to install Fail2Ban on your droplet. This role should be part of your Ansible playbook.
- Configure Fail2Ban to monitor your SSH and web server logs. This will involve writing jail configurations for each service you want to protect.
- Each jail configuration should define the log path, the fail regex (which defines what an attack looks like), the ban time, and the max retry count.

**Testing**

Testing is a crucial part of any project. Here's how you can test your setup:

- Test your Hugo site by accessing it from a web browser. Ensure that all pages load correctly and that the site behaves as expected.
- Test Fluentd by checking the destination of your logs. If Fluentd is set up correctly, you should see logs from your Hugo site at the defined destination.
- Test Fail2Ban by attempting to log in to your droplet with incorrect credentials multiple times. After a certain number of attempts, Fail2Ban should ban your IP address.

**Maintenance and Monitoring Best Practices**

Maintaining and monitoring your setup is crucial to ensure it continues to function correctly. Here are some best practices:

- Regularly update your system and applications. This includes your droplet's operating system, Docker, Hugo, Fluentd, and Fail2Ban. Regular updates will ensure you have the latest security patches and features.
- Monitor your system logs regularly. This will help you identify any potential issues before they become serious problems. Fluentd can help with this by aggregating your logs in one place.
- Set up alerts for critical issues. This could be done through Fluentd or another monitoring tool. Alerts will ensure you are notified immediately when something goes wrong.
- Regularly backup your data. This includes your Hugo site and any data stored on your droplet. Regular backups will ensure you can quickly recover in case of data loss.
- Regularly review and update your security measures. This includes your Fail2Ban configuration and any other security measures you have in place. Regular reviews will ensure your security measures remain effective against new threats.
