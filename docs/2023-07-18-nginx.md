Create “.well-known” and “pki-validation” folders at example.com/.well-known/pki-validation/ and upload the validation file from this page (Edit methods).

You should be able to access the file via both links:

```

## Response

To set up HTTP validation for your Nginx server on Ubuntu, you need to create the required directories and upload the validation file. Here are the steps:

1. SSH into your server:

```bash
ssh username@your_server_ip
```

2. Navigate to the root directory of your website. This is typically located at `/var/www/html` or `/var/www/example.com/html`, but it may vary depending on your configuration:

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com/html
```

3. Create the `.well-known` and `pki-validation` directories:

```bash
mkdir -p .well-known/pki-validation
```

4. Now, you need to upload the validation file to the `pki-validation` directory. You can use `scp` or `rsync` from your local machine to do this. Here's an example using `scp`:

```bash
scp /path/to/local/validation/file username@your_server_ip:/var/www/example.com/html/.well-known/pki-validation/
```

Replace `/path/to/local/validation/file` with the path to the validation file on your local machine.

5. After uploading the file, you should be able to access it via the links provided. If not, you may need to adjust the permissions of the directories and file:

```bash
chmod -R 755 .well-known
```

6. Finally, ensure that your Nginx configuration is set up to serve files from the `.well-known` directory. In your Nginx configuration file, you should have a block like this:

```bash
location ~ /.well-known {
    allow all;
}
```

If you don't have this block, add it inside the `server` block, then save and exit the file. Test the configuration to make sure there are no syntax errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the test is successful, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now, you should be able to access the validation file from the URLs provided.
